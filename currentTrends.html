<h1>Signs of the <b>End of the World</b></h1>
<div class="mc0201">
<p>The year is now 2018 and many people around the globe are wondering if the end of the world is near. I don't think there has ever been such a
widespread interest in this topic like there is today. And who can blame people for wondering, when you see what is happening to our world.
The signs of the end are prevalent. War, famine, natural disasters, incredible and rapid increase in knowledge. Poisoning of the air and
water. Birds of the air and the Fish of the seas dying in huge numbers. These are just a few of the Biblical signs which you can see on
our <b><a href="http://www.signs-of-end-times.com">end time signs</a> home page</b>.</p>
<p class=center><span class=fontsizeb>Scientific FACT that supports the Bible &rarr; &rarr; <a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Injlszfzst8">THIS WORLD IS DYING</a> &larr; &larr;</span></p>
<p class=center><span class=fontsizeb>The signs are <b><u>so strong</u></b> now and the evidence is so clear that any person willing to accept the
truth can see that the end of the world, as we know it, is <b><u>near</u></b>.</span></p>
<p class=center><span class=fontsizec>&rarr;&rarr; <a href="http://www.signs-of-end-times.com/what-must-do-saved.html">WHAT MUST I DO TO BE SAVED?</a> &larr;&larr;</span></p>
<p>Now the signs of the end that we are dealing with on this page are the signs we find within <i>2 Timothy 3:1-5 ...'This
know also, that <b>in the last days</b> perilous times shall come. For men shall be lovers of their own selves, covetous, boasters, proud,
blasphemers, disobedient to parents, unthankful, unholy, without natural affection, trucebreakers, false accusers, incontinent, fierce,
despisers of those that are good, traitors, heady, highminded, lovers of pleasures more than lovers of God; Having a form of godliness,
but denying the power thereof: from such turn away.'</i></p>
<p class=center><span class=fontsizeb>These verses predicted a great moral degeneration in our society.</span></p>
<p>But before we get into these last day signs, take a look at this Bible verse also ... <i>2 Peter 3:3-4 ...'Knowing this first, that
<b>there shall come in the last days scoffers, walking after their own lusts</b>, and <u>saying</u>, Where is the promise of his coming? for since the
fathers fell asleep, <u>all things continue as they were from the beginning of the creation</u>.'</i> ... Do we live in a day of scoffers?  Most
certainly! Talk about the end times and the majority of people, including many Christians will just laugh it off saying that <i>&quot;all things continue as they were
from the beginning of the creation.&quot;</i> in <b><u>PERFECT</u></b> fulfillment of this Bible
prophecy above!</p>
<p>So lets look at just some of the signs from the above Bible verse in Timothy and apply it to our time and see if it tells us that we are living at the end of the
world, just before the second coming of Jesus.</p>
<p class=center><span class=fontsizeb>Remember, these signs are purely dealing with the moral decline in society. See our <b><a href="http://www.signs-of-end-times.com">end time signs</a> home page</b>
for more general Bible signs.</span></p>
<h2>End of World Sign - PERILOUS TIMES</h2>
<p><img src="image/perilous-times.jpg" alt="Endtimes Perilous Times" width="227" height="128" class="floatleft" />Are we living in perilous times?  There is no doubt about that.  Let's just take one example of what is happening today.  There are
uprisings all around the world, with people protesting and rioting and governments toppling.  The people are starting to see
the power they have if they get together.  And this is a very dangerous situation and one that will lead to the
image of the beast being formed, which will bring on the enforcement of the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.markofbeast.net" rel="nofollow">beast's mark</a>.
And with the economy melting all around the world, with countries nearing bankruptcy, the world is becoming ripe for a one world
currency, which will aid with enforcing the mark and stop those who refuse the mark from <i>&quot;buying and selling&quot;</i> (Rev.13).</p>
<p class=center><span class=fontsizeb><i><b>&quot;2014 was a catastrophic year for millions caught up in violence.&quot;</b></i></span> (<a target="_blank" href="https://www.amnesty.org/press-releases/2015/02/global-response-to-atrocities-by-states-and-armed-groups-shameful-and-ineffective/" rel="nofollow">source</a>)</p>
<h2>End of World Sign - LOVERS OF PLEASURE MORE THAN GOD</h2>
<p>This sign of the end is powerful just on its own! Do we live in a world full of pleasure seekers?  Most <img src="image/lovers-of-pleasure.jpg" alt="Endtime lovers of pleasure" width="279" height="139" class="floatright" />certainly. Again, to
fulfill this end of world sign, we only need look at the professing Christian churches. A great majority of
professing Christians are lovers of pleasure more than they love God.  They fill their lives with television, partying, socializing,
reading novels, playing games, wasting time on social networks like facebook, and God gets little of their time.</p>
<p>The films, tv programs and music that professing Christians are happy to listen to today is just shocking!  There is no distinction
between your average Christian and a worldly person today.  Should
Christians listen to secular music and watch all the garbage that they do?  No, not at all.</p>
<p class=center><span class=fontsizeb><b>The programs and films that are watched by professed Christians today are an <u>abomination</u> to God</b></span></p>
<p>Now, go back 50 years or more and this would not be the problem it is today, because life was much simpler back then, without all the worldly entertainment.  How many
Christian homes give time to worship God as a family everyday? Not too many I guess, because they are too busy watching their favorite
tv program, or reading their favorite novel, or playing their favorite games. We certainly live in a pleasure seeking world.  This sign of the last days is fulfilled in our generation.</p>
<p class=center><span class=fontsizec>Men are still living as if nothing is going to happen. Pleasure lovers are still crowding into bars,
theatres, gambling halls and sports arenas. The highest excitement prevails, and yet probation's hour is fast closing, and every case is about to be
eternally decided. Satan sees that his time is short, and he's always at work that men may be deceived, deluded, occupied and
entranced, until the day of probation shall be ended, and the door of mercy be <u><b>forever shut</b></u>.</span></p>
<h2>End of World Sign - PEOPLE WILL BE COVETOUS</h2>
<p>Well, we certainly live in a covetous age, where people clamour after the latest and best things.  And not only do we covet possessions,
we also covet after other men and women, whether married or not. The majority of people today are seeking after worldly riches, rather than eternal heavenly
riches.</p>
<p>Again, this end of the world sign also applies to the churches of today.  <b>Just look at what <a target="_blank" href="http://www.worshipinspiritandtruth.net/page9.htm" rel="nofollow">the
prosperity gospel</a> is producing!</b>  Professing Christians just in it for earthly riches.</p>
<p>Also, think about how many women are coveted and lusted after everyday, because of the tight, revealing clothing they wear these days. And
not just on the streets, but in the churches also! And again, the television, internet, magazines, billboards, etc, causes us to covet and clamour
after the latest things this world has to offer. No doubt we live in a covetous time like no other.</p>
<h2>End of World Sign - PEOPLE WILL BE BOASTERS AND PROUD</h2>
<p>Pride was the original sin that caused Satan to fall from his exalted position in Heaven, and pride is the sin that the majority of
people cherish in this world today.  LOOK AT ME is the way people are today.  Too proud to be humble
before God and turn the other cheek to their fellow neighbour. Too proud to stop and help someone in need just in case others see them.</p>
<p>And as mentioned above, the way people dress these days compared to times past is amazing!  Tight, trendy, revealing clothes to make people look
at them and like them. Driving the latest cars and wanting to live in the nicest homes.  LOOK AT ME, I've made it in this world!</p>
<h2>End of World Sign - CHILDREN DISOBEDIENT TO PARENTS</h2>
<p>Let me give you a quote from a newspaper in the UK after the riots there in August 2011 ...<img src="image/young-thugs.jpg" alt="Young Thugs" width="211" height="143" class="floatright" /></p>
<p class=center><b><i>&quot;You have a generation of kids now that don't respect their parents or the police ... When we were youngsters
we were made to have respect for the olders. Now if an older was to slap a youth that kid is going to pick up a hammer.&quot;</i></b> (<a target="_blank" href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/2011/aug/09/london-riots-kids-parents-police" rel="nofollow">source</a>)</p>
<p>This is one of the many signs of the end of the world, <u>and it is pointing clearly to our generation</u>. The youths of today go about in gangs
having little respect for their elders and parents, and pretty much little respect for anything, which <a target="_blank" href="http://www.myfoxdetroit.com/story/19642028/owner-loitering-teens-taking-over-detroit-gas-station-driving-business-away" rel="nofollow">this business man in Detroit</a> will
tell you.  And why is that?  Because society today teaches them that there is no God. They have no idea what Christ Jesus has done for them, and therefore they do not have any future.  So really, it's not
surprising that they rebel!</p>
<h2>End of World Sign - PEOPLE WILL BE UNTHANKFUL</h2>
<p>Many of us are unthankful today because we have been so conditioned by the world to just take things for granted. Just have a think
about your daily life. Are you really thankful to God for the many blessings He has bestowed upon you? Do you thank
Him for waking you up in the morning? For feeding you? For providing you with a job and income? Do you thank Him for His wonderful
creation? And most of all, do you thank God everyday for giving us His Son Christ Jesus? Do you contemplate that amazing sacrifice He
made? Now if Christians are unthankful, then what are those outside the faith like? We certainly live in a time of ungreatfulness. Spare a thought
for those who DON'T have today!</p>
<p>There will be some people reading this that have great troubles and difficulties in their lives.  But you CAN be thankful.  Thankful that
God has promised us a future, if we believe in His Son Jesus Christ, and follow Him.</p>
<h2>End of World Sign - PEOPLE WILL BE UNHOLY</h2>
<p>Now this sign of the end of the world is an amazing one.  Do you know why?  Because I only need to talk about professing Christians here.
Go back just 50 years and you would find a world with Christians who were far more holy and humble than they are today. Many believe
that we need not keep the ten commandments anymore, just as long
as we &quot;believe&quot; in Jesus.  And what does this lead to? A people who continue living in sin and being unholy.</p>
<p class=center><i><b>Jude 1:4 ...'For there are certain men crept in unawares, who were before of old ordained to this condemnation,
ungodly men, <u>turning the grace of our God into lasciviousness</u>, and denying the only Lord God, and our Lord Jesus Christ.'</i></b></p>
<p>These men have certainly crept into the churches and as a result the churches are full of unconverted, unholy people today, who have
turned the grace of God into a licence to sin!  Much more so today than
in times past. Churches today have become more like social places, theatres and concerts, rather than holy places of worship. Christians
have lost the Bible truth about <a target="_blank" href="http://www.worshipinspiritandtruth.net/page2.htm" rel="nofollow">how to worship in Church</a>.</p>
<p>Christians seem to think that they will be saved IN their sins, rather than Jesus saving them FROM their sins.  There is little effort
today being made in turning away from sin and living a holy life for God. And if this is the state of the majority of Christians, then
what is the rest of the world like? Yes, this end of the world sign is being fulfilled today.  We are sure living in the last days.
<h2>End of World Sign - PEOPLE WITHOUT NATURAL AFFECTION</h2>
<p>Another great sign of the end of the world! Just look at how homosexuality is being pushed and accepted <img src="image/gay.jpg" alt="Endtime without natural affection" width="284" height="128" class="floatright" />around the world today.
The picture on the right is just one of the many articles from the news today, showing that homosexuality is becoming the &quot;norm&quot;.
And not just in the world, but in the churches too!</p>
<p>We are also now seeing churches accept <b>ACTIVE</b> homosexuals. And not only that, many churches are now placing these people in leadership
positions!  Homosexuality is being pushed through television also, with many programs portraying homosexuality as normal.  This is
all in complete disobedience to God's clear Word ... <i>1 Corinthians 6:9-10 ...'Do you not know that the unrighteous will not inherit
the kingdom of God? Do not be deceived. Neither fornicators, nor idolaters, nor adulterers, <b><u>nor homosexuals</u></b>, nor sodomites, nor
thieves, nor covetous, nor drunkards, nor revilers, nor extortioners will inherit the kingdom of God.'</i></p>
<p>So many signs showing we are <b>IN</b> the last days!</p>
<h2>End of World Sign - DESPISERS OF THOSE THAT ARE GOOD</h2>
<p>We live in an age today where people will not take correction or rebuke for their sins. If you warn Christians for wrong doing, many
of them will just say <i>&quot;stop judging me!&quot;</i> and will not take correction.  Even though the Bible says that the Word of
God is to be used for instruction, correction and rebuke.</p>
<p class=center><i><b>2 Timothy 3:16 ...'All scripture is given by inspiration of God, and is profitable for doctrine, <u>for reproof,
for correction</u>, for instruction in righteousness.'</i></b></p>
<p>This day and age, people are CRITICIZED for being pious.  If you are seen to be a good, holy person, then the world will sneer at you,
being labelled as a &quot;goody two shoes&quot;.  The world is so full of sin today that it cannot handle people who are good.  This Bible
sign is applicable more for our day than any other before us, and shows we are living in the last days.</p>
<h2>End of World Sign - PEOPLE WILL BE LOVERS OF THEMSELVES</h2>
<p>You will now see how Paul above in 2 Timothy is talking about our day.  These signs of the last days are so clearly speaking
about our generation. Do people love themselves today by putting themselves before God and other people?  Most certainly.  We seem to
be more concerned about how we look on the outside, rather than how we look on the inside (our heart).  Everything now is commercialized
to the extreme to make people think about <i>ME, ME, ME!</i>. If you walked down the street just 50 years ago, you would have seen
the majority of people dressed modestly in smart, humble clothing, <b><u>covering</u></b> their bodies.  Today if you do the same you will see the majority of people
dressed in tight revealing clothing to make themselves look &quot;sexy&quot;.</p>
<p>Today, the television, radio, newspapers, magazines and internet are full of adverts to try and lure us into buying the next best thing, to
make us look better than the next person.  Yes, this is certainly a sign for the time we live in.  And what makes this sign appropriate
more for our day is the fact that it applies to the majority of professing Christians also!  The church is full of people who have no idea
what it truly means to worship God, and think more of
themselves than they do of God and other people.  Just look at America!  The majority of people there profess to be Christian.  So
why is it that there are thousands of people starving to death everyday?  Because professing Christians are too busy with themselves
to worry about the needy.  <b>And Satan has deceived the majority of professing Christians into thinking it is ok to spend the money
that God has entrusted them with on THEMSELVES, rather than using it to help the poor and further God's kingdom</b>.</p>
<h2>End of World Sign - A &QUOT;FORM&QUOT; OF GODLINESS ONLY</h2>
<p>Now this is an end time sign pointing purely to Christians. And is it fulfilled in our day?  Yes. The Christian churches are
FULL of people who only have a &quot;form&quot; of Godliness.  How many Christians actually
LIVE the faith that they proclaim?  How many LIVE according to the way laid out in the Bible?  Not many, which is why Jesus
said ... <i>&quot;will I find faith when I return?&quot;</i> (Luke 18:8). And which
is why He said that only <i>&quot;few&quot;</i> would find the narrow way, as the majority will head down the broad way to destruction.
Why?  Because they loved the world more than they loved God!</p>
<p>Yes, there may be &quot;revivals&quot; going on around the world today.  But many of them only have that &quot;form&quot; of Godliness
and are not filled with the true Spirit of God.  Anyone can rent a stadium. Put on an elaborate &quot;Christian&quot; rock band on stage.
Say &quot;nice&quot; things to make people feel good. Draw many people through the doors and call it &quot;revival&quot;. But do you
know what TRUE revival is?  <b>Turning away from sin and living holy lives for God</b>.  The so called revivals happening today are nothing
more than worldly excitement.</p>
<h2>Are we Living in the Last Days?</h2>
<p>There is no doubt whatsoever, that the signs of the end of the world in the Bible are pointing to our generation.  Anyone can see the
great moral degeneration that has happened over the past 50+ years.  The moral depravation of this world has reached such a point that
we are now like Sodom and Gomorrha just before God destroyed that city with fire ... <i>2 Peter 2:6 ...'And turning the cities of Sodom
and Gomorrha into ashes, condemned them with an overthrow, <b>making them an example unto those that after should live ungodly</b>.'</i></p>
<p>So is the world going
to end in the next couple of years?  We cannot set dates, but from all the signs, we can know that the second coming is 'at the door'.
There are still some things yet to happen that end time prophecy reveals, like the mark of
the beast being enforced. And once the mark of the beast is enforced, we will know that we are in the VERY last days, right at the end of the world.
But please do not wait until that happens to get ready.  We need to get ready now and live for Christ Jesus and the Kingdom of Heaven every day.</p>
<p>Don't forget, none of us know when <i>OUR</i> last day will be.  So we need to be
ready everyday. Satan's deceptions and temptations are going to get stronger and stronger. So please seek the truth of God's Word in the
Bible and start living for Christ Jesus.</p>

<p>Take a look at 2 Timothy 3 above again. EVERY sign that is given in those verses are specifically pointing to our day today. These are the
signs showing that the end of the world is near.  We ARE living in the last days, there can be no doubt.</p>
