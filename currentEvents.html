<h1>Bible Signs of the <b>End Times</b></h1>
<div class="mc0201">
<p class=center><span class=fontsizec>WE <u>NEVER</u> SET DATES. We merely proclaim the Bible truth concerning end time <u>signs</u>. It is Satan who keeps 
setting these dates to turn people away from truth.</span></p>
<p><span class=float-right><iframe width="295" height="220" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/onk6iFJN7XA?rel=0" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen></iframe></span></p>
<p>When Noah and Lot warned their respective people of God's coming judgment and destruction, the people would not listen.
<b>Instead they treated Noah and Lot as &quot;extremists&quot;</b>. Then the destruction that DID come found the people unprepared. <b>Thus it will be when Jesus Christ returns</b>. As in the days of Noah and Lot, the
soon return of our Lord Jesus will be a snare unto the people who do not heed the warning and surrender their lives to Him who knows all. (Luke 17:26-30)</p>
<p class=center><span class=fontsizec><b>This world is hearing and seeing the <u>last</u> warning message from God. <i>Multitudes, multitudes
in the valley of decision; for the day of the Lord is near in the valley of decision!</i></b> (Joel 3:14)</span></p>
<p class=center><span class=fontsizec>&rarr;&rarr; <a href="http://www.signs-of-end-times.com/three-angels-messages.html">FINAL WARNING AND CALL OF MERCY</a> &larr;&larr;</br>
&rarr;&rarr; <a href="http://www.signs-of-end-times.com/what-must-do-saved.html">WHAT MUST I DO TO BE SAVED?</a> &larr;&larr;</span></p>
<p>What you are about to discover in this site is <b>amazing evidence</b> that we in 2018, are living right in the end of times for this world as we know it. The
<a href="http://www.signs-of-end-times.com/daniel-2-prophecy.html">prophecy of Daniel 2</a> alone shows we are in the 'time of the end', and all the other evidence proves we are in the very end times.
The Biblical signs are clear for all to see, and after reading through this site with open eyes,
even the scoffers will struggle to argue against it.  Sure, many people throughout history have been proclaiming that
<i>they</i> were living in the last days and the end of the world was nigh, and some of the Bible signs have always existed from
the early days. But <u>never</u> has there been a time before when <b><u>ALL</u></b> these events were evident in so many diverse places and with such
frequency and intensity. Our Generation is the <b>FIRST</b> generation to fulfill ALL the biblical signs. So we will show you from the many
following signs on this and other pages, that without doubt we are living in the final years that the Bible prophesied were to come.</p>
<p class=center><span class=fontsizec><u>Please note</u>: We are NOT here to set dates or times. We are here only to warn the world that the second coming of 
Jesus Christ is NEAR, even <i><b>&quot;at the door&quot;</b></i> ... <i>Matthew 24:33 ...'So likewise ye, <u>when ye shall see all
these things, know that it is near, even at the doors</u>.'</i></span></p>
<p>If you take into consideration all the signs, there is no mistaking that our generation is living in the last
days, nearing the second coming of Jesus. Problem is, Satan can see how close we are to the
end of the world, which is why he brings certain 'end times groups' into the spotlight, proclaiming false dates for the second coming,
which when those dates come and go, causes many people to turn away completely from the truth.  The truth being that <b><u>WE ARE</u></b>
living in the end times. The Bible is very clear on that.  We just can't set specific dates for Jesus' return.  But we CAN know when
the end is near ... And we are certainly now seeing <i>&quot;<b>ALL</b> these things&quot;</i>.</p>
<p>Before you read on, <b>please note this important point</b>.  In Matthew 24, Jesus speaks of wars, earthquakes and such things, but says these
are just the <i>&quot;beginning of sorrows&quot;</i> and <i>&quot;the end is not yet&quot;</i>.  Now that word &quot;sorrows&quot; in the original language meant &quot;birth
pangs&quot;, the pain in childbirth. Now birth pangs speak of frequency and intensity.  And as a woman gets nearer the birth, the
&quot;pangs&quot; become more frequent and intense.  This is true also for the signs of the end times.  These signs began not long
after Jesus' day, and as Jesus quoted, the end would not yet be, because this was just the <i><u>beginning</u></i> of sorrows.  But throughout
history we have seen the &quot;pangs&quot; (signs) become more frequent and intense, <u>culminating in the day we live in now where the pangs are
so frequent and intense that we must be right at the time of &quot;delivery&quot;</u>, when Jesus is to return. So don't let anyone
fool you into believing that the signs today are just the beginning of sorrows and the end is not yet.</p>
<p class=center><i>Hebrews 1:1-2 ...'God, who at sundry times and in divers manners spake in time past unto the fathers by the prophets, hath <b>in these last days</b> 
spoken unto us by his Son, whom he hath appointed heir of all things, by whom also he made the worlds.'</i></p>
<p class=center><span class=fontsizec><b><i>&quot;The beginning of sorrows&quot;</i> started nearly 2000 years ago with the persecution of
the early church and the destruction of Jerusalem. <u>We</u> are living right at the end of time</b>.</span></p>
<h2>Historical Evidence - Daniel 2</h2>
<p class=center><img src="image/daniel-2-statuea.jpg" alt="Daniel 2 Image Nebuchadnezzar" width="282" height="355" class="floatleft" /><i>Daniel 2:31-45 ..'Thou, O king, sawest, and behold a great image .. This image's head was of fine gold, his breast and
his arms of silver, his belly and his thighs of brass, His legs of iron, his feet part of iron and part of clay. Thou sawest till that a stone
was cut out without hands, which smote the image upon his feet ... Thou art this head of gold ... And after thee shall arise another kingdom
inferior to thee, and another third kingdom of brass, which shall bear rule over all the earth. And the fourth kingdom shall be strong as iron ...
And whereas thou sawest the feet and toes, part of potters' clay, and part of iron, the kingdom shall be divided ... Forasmuch as thou sawest that
the stone was cut out of the mountain without hands, and that it brake in pieces the iron, the brass, the clay, the silver, and the gold; <b>the great
God hath made known to the king <u>what shall come to pass hereafter</u></b>.'</i></p>
<p>More than being a &quot;sign&quot; of the times, this is an historical FACT of where we stand in earth's history. The vision that God gave King Nebuchadnezzar
as shown in the Bible verses above, and subsequently the interpretation to the prophet Daniel, consisted of an image of a man which depicted all the &quot;ages&quot; and ruling
kingdoms from the time of Babylon until the second coming of Christ Jesus (the destroying Rock, which is the eternal kingdom of God).</p>
<p class=center><span class=fontsizec>By the way, if you are not convinced that the Bible is any sort of authority, then study the <a href="http://www.signs-of-end-times.com/daniel-2-prophecy.html">prophecy of Daniel 2</a>. It perfectly
foretold the future kingdoms of this world up until the end of time. And history confirms it as ACCURATE.</span></p>
<p>As you can see from the picture, the different parts of the man represented the different &quot;ages&quot; and ruling kingdoms of this world. And what
is the last &quot;age&quot;? It's the feet of the image. And when did the last age start? It started in the year 476 AD. when Rome fell and split
into the ten kingdoms of Europe. Which means this world has been in the &quot;last age&quot; for over 1500 YEARS! So add that to
the amazing signs of the last days that you will see throughout this site, and you are left with no doubt that we are living right at the
end of the toes on the image and right at the end of time, soon to see the second coming of Christ Jesus.</p>
<h2>End Time Sign - DANIEL 11 AND KING OF THE NORTH</h2>
<p class=center><i><b>Daniel 11:45 ...'And he shall plant the tabernacles of his palace between the seas in the glorious holy mountain; yet he shall come to his end, and none shall help him.'</b></i></p>
<p>Now the very next verse in Daniel 12:1 says ... <i>'And <b>at that time</b> shall Michael stand up'</i>, indicating the close of probation and final time of trouble
before Jesus returns. At what time? At the time that the 'he' in Daniel 11:45 plants the tabernacles of his palace in between the seas in the glorious holy mountain, which
is Jerusalem in Israel. The 'he' in this Bible verse is the king of the north. And if you read our page on <a target="_blank" href="http://www.end-times-prophecy.org/eastern-question-daniel11.html" rel="nofollow">the 
king of the north</a>, and study this for yourself, you will see that the king of the north is Turkey and Islam. And what does Daniel 11:45 say Turkey and Islam
are going to do? Plant the tabernacles of his palace in Jerusalem. In other words, Turkey and Islam are going to 'move into' Jerusalem to take control. Do we
see anything like that happening today?</p>

<p>So as you can see, this is very much on the table today! And with Donald Trump [being led by his Evangelical advisors] moving the US embassy to Jerusalem, this
is going to anger Turkey and the Muslims even more. So keep watch for this sign, as it will be an indication that probation is about to end, the time of trouble
will begin and Jesus will be about to return!</p> 
<h2>End Time Sign - INCREASE OF KNOWLEDGE</h2>
<p class=center><i><b>Daniel 12:4 ...'even to the time of the end: many shall run to and fro, and knowledge shall be increased.'</b></i></p>
<p>I Just love this
sign, because it is clearly pointing to our day today, and it <u>cannot</u> be refuted by anyone. Throughout history we have had a <u>slow</u> and
little increase in knowledge.  But take a look at the
<b>EXPLOSION</b> of knowledge over the past 150 years! Up until recently in history, the fastest form of transport was a horse. Now
man can travel at hundreds of miles per hour, and cross the globe in a day! Technology has developed at a rapid pace,
which has led to great improvements in computer power, scientific discoveries and the medical profession.  Just look at how much we have learned about the human body with
things like DNA and Cellular Structures etc. And how about <i>&quot;running to and fro&quot;</i>? This is pointing specifically to our day
with planes, trains, automobiles and the busyness of modern day life. We are definately running to and fro and have knowledge like no time before us.</p>
<p class=center><span class=fontsizec><i>&quot;run to and fro and knowledge increase&quot;</i> applies also to knowledge of Bible truths ...</span></p>
<p><a target="_blank" href="http://www.signs-of-end-times.com/timeline.jpg"><img src="image/timeline2.jpg" alt="" width="294" height="140" class="floatright" /></a></p>
<p>This Bible sign has a <b>dual application</b>. <i>&quot;running to and fro and knowledge increase&quot;</i>
also applies to knowledge of Biblical truths (see Amos 8:12).  During the &quot;dark ages&quot;, for over 1000 years, knowledge of Biblical truths were surpressed
by the Roman Catholic Church. But since the protestant reformation and breakaway from Rome, God's people have been running to and fro in His Word FREELY and knowledge about
great Bible truths have been revealed. God now has an end time remnant
church with the FULL gospel truth to take to the world before the end comes, which was needed to fulfill the sign about taking the
true gospel message to the whole world. Which you will read about further down the page.</p>
<h2>End Time Sign - ABILITY TO ENFORCE THE MARK</h2>
<p class=center><i><b>Revelation 13:17 ...'And that no man might buy or sell, save he that had the mark, or the name of the beast, or the
number of his name.'</b></i></p>
<p>Now this is a sign that most people miss!  Have a think about it ... What needs to happen in order for the &quot;beast system&quot;
to stop people from buying and selling if they refuse the mark?  We need to have a worldwide financial system whereby everything bought
and sold is through electronic means, not cash.</p>
<p>Has there been any time in history where this could happen?  No.  Are WE living in a day where this could happen?  Most certainly, yes!
And the powers of this world are now trying to make cash obsolete, and are actively pushing pure electronic forms of payment, like
&quot;PayPal&quot; and &quot;Google Wallet&quot; for instance. Take a look at the news and you will see this being reported in different countries of the world.</p>
<p class=center><a target="_blank" href="http://www.thelocal.se/20141012/sweden-close-to-being-cashless-society-report" rel="nofollow">Sweden close to being a Cashless Society</a></p>

<p class=center><a target="_blank" href="http://allafrica.com/stories/201303140039.html" rel="nofollow">Cashless Society Drive Gaining Momentum in Rwanda</a></p>
<p>Above is just a few examples of the major push throughout the world for a cashless society. We have the techonology to do this now, which in
times past wasn't possible. And look at the financial turmoil around the world today.  This will help in bringing in a &quot;unified&quot; currency to help make
it possible to enforce the mark of the beast.  Technology isn't the mark, but technology is needed for proper enforcement of it.  This is a <u>SURE</u> sign of the end times!</p>
<h2>End Time Sign - MAN OF SIN REVEALED</h2>
<p class=center><i><b>2 Thessalonians 2:3 ...'Let
no man deceive you by any means: for that day shall not come, except there come a falling
away first, and that man of sin be revealed, the son of perdition.'</b></i></p>
<p>Paul here is saying that <i>&quot;THAT DAY&quot;</i>, the second coming of Christ, will not come until the falling away happens and
that <b>man of sin is revealed</b>.  Now many professed Christians today believe that the 'falling away' is something that will happen in the last days. But this
is a wrong view, because the falling away began not long after the New Testament church and was completely fulfilled when the Roman Catholic Church took control
and merged Christianity with Paganism, and punished anyone who did not bow to her so called 'authority' and false teachings. And that man of sin who was &quot;revealed&quot; to the world during the
Protestant reformation is none other than the pope(s) of the Roman Catholic Church.</p>
<p class=center><span class=fontsizec>See proof of who the man of sin is <a target="_blank" href="http://www.end-times-prophecy.org/man-of-sin-revealed.html" rel="nofollow">HERE</a>.</span></p>
<p>So, the falling away has happened and the man of sin HAS been revealed.  Therefore the second coming of Christ can happen and this
shows we are living in the end times.</p>
<h2>End Time Sign - VIOLENCE AND SEXUAL IMMORALITY</h2>
<p class=center><i><b>Matthew 24:37 ...'But as the days of Noah were, so shall also the coming of the Son of man be.'</b></i></p>
<p class=center><i><b>Luke 17:28-30 ...'Likewise also as it was in the days of Lot; they did eat, they drank, they bought, they sold,
they planted, they builded; But the same day that Lot went out of Sodom it rained fire and brimstone from heaven, and destroyed them all.
Even thus shall it be in the day when the Son of man is revealed.'</b></i></p>
<p>What was it like in Noah's day and Lot's day?  We need to go to two other Bible verses to see what it was like.  Genesis 6:13 tells us that in Noah's
day the <i>&quot;earth was filled with violence.&quot;</i> And in Jude 1:7 it says that in Lot's day, Sodom and Gomorrha had given itself over to
<i>&quot;fornication and strange flesh&quot;.</i>  So violence prevailed in Noah's day and sexual immorality (including homosexuality) prevailed in
Lot's day.  And this would be a sign of the end times before Christ Jesus returns.</p>
<p class=center><span class=fontsizeb>2017 - <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/ng-interactive/2017/oct/02/america-mass-shootings-gun-violence" rel="nofollow">1,516 MASS SHOOTINGS IN 1,735 DAYS: AMERICA'S GUN [VIOLENCE] CRISIS</a></span></p>

<p>So our question is, does violence and sexual immorality (including homosexuality) prevail in the world today?  Very much so, yes!  Not only
does violence and fornication rage across the whole world, homosexuality has become a &quot;norm&quot;. Since 2001, at least
14 countries have fully legalized homosexual marriage, <b>Argentina, Belgium, Canada, Denmark, Iceland, Netherlands, Norway, Portugal, Spain, South Africa,
Sweden, New Zealand, Uraguay, France</b>, with some parts of <b>Mexico</b> and <b>America</b> doing the same. And there are more countries being added to this list all the time.</p>

<h2>End Time Sign - RISE IN SPIRITUALISM</h2>
<p class=center><i><b>1 Timothy 4:1 ...'Now the Spirit speaketh expressly, that in the latter times some shall depart from the faith, giving heed to
seducing spirits, and doctrines of devils.'</b></i></p>
<p>How about a rise in spiritualism and the occult in the world? Have we seen this? Well, just look at the television and movies today. &quot;Twilight&quot;,
&quot;Harry Potter&quot;, &quot;Lord of the Rings&quot;, and a whole host of other television series and movies containing the occult and spiritualism.
It has invaded our lives like no other time before us. And what is the cause of this? <b>It is the false teaching of the immortality of the 'soul'</b>.</p>
<p class=center>Spiritualism is also the cause of these '<a target="_blank" href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2545668/Is-proof-near-death-experiences-ARE-real-Extraordinary-new-book-intensive-care-nurse-reveals-dramatic-evidence-says-banish-fear-dying.html" rel="nofollow">near death experiences</a>' which Satan is deceiving more and more people with.</p>
<p>Many people don't realize that spiritualism has also invaded the majority of churches around the world, due to this false
teaching of the immortality of the soul. Yet the Bible clearly teaches that <i>&quot;the dead know NOTHING&quot;</i> (Ecclesiastes 9:5), and that when
we die we return to the dust of the ground from where we came (Genesis 3:19). But the churches have embraced this false teaching of the immortal soul, which is another sign of the
times we live in.</p>
<p class=center><i>&quot;A belief in spiritual manifestations opens the door to seducing spirits and doctrines of devils, and thus the influence of
evil angels will be felt in the churches.&quot;</i> (E.White, The Great Controversy, p.603-604)</p>

the field, and with the fowls of heaven; yea, the fishes of the sea also shall be taken away.'</i></b></p>
<p>This one has become a fairly recent phenomenon.  During the last few years we have seen fish,
birds and other animals die in huge numbers.  Since 2010, millions of fish have been turning up dead
in lakes, rivers and the sea, with this <a target="_blank" href="http://coastalscience.noaa.gov/news/habs/researchers-discover-that-red-tide-species-is-deadlier-than-first-thought-phys-org/" rel="nofollow">deadly red tide</a> partly to blame.

<h2>End Time Sign - NATURAL DISASTERS</h2>
<p class=center><i><b>Luke 21:25-26 ...'and upon the earth

number was broken again, with 99 Disaster Declarations given, costing over 32 Billion Dollars. And 2012 produced another year of record breaking disasters. Dr. Robert Hartwig states ...

<h2>End Time Sign - EARTHQUAKES</h2>
<p class=center><i><b>Matthew 24:7 ...'and earthquakes in divers places.'</b></i></p>
<p>The scoffers love to bash this one, but from the evidence available, it is clear that earthquakes are not only increasing in frequency, but also
appearing in more and more &quot;diverse places&quot;, which the Bible predicted.</p>
<p class=center><span class=fontsizec><b>Remember, these signs are to <u>intensify</u> during the last days, and that is exactly what is happening
with earthquakes.</b></span></p>
<p>Take a look at the following information and judge for yourself.</p>
<p>New Zealand felt a record 32,000 earthquakes in 2016 - <a target="_blank" href="http://www.news.com.au/world/breaking-news/shaky-nz-felt-record-32000-quakes-in-2016/news-story/f2bc47cdbed28651f28962a32873ab7c" rel="nofollow">link</a></p>
<p>We had a 'millenium's worth' of earthquakes in just 2 years, during 2014 and 2015 (<a target="_blank" href="http://news.yahoo.com/millennium-worth-earthquakes-states-going-215022918.html" rel="nofollow">source</a>).</p>

results are in agreement with the USGS statistics page, which shows an increase in the frequency of stronger earthquakes (M > 5.0).&quot;</i> (<a target="_blank" href="http://guardianlv.com/2012/12/earthquakes-the-fuse-that-ignites-volcanoes-have-increased-worldwide/" rel="nofollow">source</a>)</p>
<p>A series of massive quakes within 2 days in 2012 prompted an earthquake expert to suggest that the earth is &quot;cracking up&quot; (<a target="_blank" href="http://www.croatiantimes.com/news/Around_the_World/2012-04-15/26423/Quake_Expert:_Earth_Cracking_Up" rel="nofollow">link</a>)

<p>God is giving us plenty of warning through these events, and we will be without excuse if that day of Christ's return comes upon us
like a thief in the night and catches us unaware.  We need to heed the signs and get ready!</p>
<p class=center>Please see these amazing videos showing a graphical look into the earthquakes around the world.  Christ said that
there would be earthquakes in &quot;diverse&quot; places, and these amazing videos certainly fulfills that prophecy.</p>

<h2>End Time Sign - UNSEALED PROPHECY</h2>
<p><span class=float-right><iframe width="295" height="210" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/bbtdOP0_AYk?rel=0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></span>
<p class=center><i><b>Daniel 12:4 ...'But thou, O Daniel, shut up the words, and seal the book, even to the time of the end.'</b></i></p>
<p>This sign carries on from the &quot;increase in knowledge&quot; sign above.  But I wanted to separate it to show you that this sign alone reveals we
are living in the last days. God tells Daniel to seal the book. In other words, to seal the prophecies contained within it.  And that
at the <b><i>&quot;time of the end&quot;</i></b>, the prophecies would be unsealed and we would know what they mean.</p>
<p class=center><span class=fontsizec>The prophecies of Daniel 2 and 7 have been <a target="_blank" href="http://www.endtimes-bibleprophecy.com/page5.htm" rel="nofollow">UNSEALED</a> &larr;&larr;</span></p>
<p class=center><span class=fontsizec>Daniel's 70 week prophecy has been <a target="_blank" href="http://www.endtimes-bibleprophecy.com/page7.htm" rel="nofollow">UNSEALED</a> &larr;&larr;</span></p>
<p class=center><span class=fontsizec>The 2300 day prophecy has been <a target="_blank" href="http://www.end-times-prophecy.org/2300-day-bible-prophecy-daniel.html" rel="nofollow">UNSEALED</a> &larr;&larr;</span></p>
<p>So this alone confirms that we are living in the end times.  But taking all the other signs
together will show us how close we are to the second coming of Christ Jesus, the Son of the living God, and the end of the world.</p>
<p class=center><span class=fontsizeb>Please see our <a target="_blank" href="http://www.end-times-prophecy.org" rel="nofollow">END TIME PROPHECY</a> website for many more Bible prophecy truths.</span></p>
<h2>End Time Sign - FALSE CHRISTS and PROPHETS</h2>
<p class=center><i><b>Matthew 24:4-5,11 ...'many shall come in My Name, saying, I am Christ ... and many false prophets shall arise
and deceive many.'</b></i></p>
<p>We've certainly had our fair share of false Christ's appearing around the world.
Also, today we have many false religions proclaiming many ways to eternal life, like Roman Catholicism, Islam, Hinduism, Buddhism, Sikhism, Folk Religions,
Wicca, and many other 'new age' movements. With false prophets like the Pope, Muhammad, Krishna, Buddha, etc., leading these religions.</p>
<p>We also have many false prophets and leaders in &quot;Christian&quot; churches, like the the
prosperity gospel preachers and people like Oprah Winfrey leading these new age movements. And millions of people have been sucked in and deceived by these 'false prophets'.
There are also many who appear to be 'sheep leading the flock' but in fact are 'inwardly ravening wolves' leading the people to destruction. People like Rick Warren who preach just enough truth to lull the unlearned mind
into following them into apostasy! Yes, this sign has certainly been fulfilled.</p>
<p class=center><span class=fontsizeb>Please prayerfully seek the truth yourself, by studying the Word of God in the Bible.</span></p>
<h2>End Time Sign - WORLD PUSHING FOR PEACE</h2>
<p class=center><i><b>1 Thessalonians 5:3 ...'For when they shall say, Peace and safety; then sudden destruction cometh upon them, as
travail upon a woman with child; and they shall not escape.'</b></i></p>
<p>Is this sign being fulfilled in our day?  Yes. There is an <a target="_blank" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CWYKb4vXlmk">ecumenical movement</a> today which we were told about in end times prophecy
that is uniting the world in an effort to bring peace.  Churches and faiths and political
leaders are uniting like never before in an effort to bring peace to this world.  But this ecumenical
movement is not of God, because we as God's people are not to unite with the world or any false religion (Amos 3:3, 2 Corinthians 6:17, Revelation 18:4). When
they do declare &quot;peace and safety&quot; then destruction will come upon them (1 Thessalonians 5:3).</p>
<h2>End Time Sign - WAR</h2>
<p class=center><b><i>Matthew 24:6-7 ...'And ye shall hear of wars ... For nation shall rise against nation and kingdom against kingdom.'</i></b></p>
<p>Many people say that
this isn't a sign of the end times, because there have been wars since the beginning. Yes there have been wars since
the beginning, but when you look at the frequency and intensity of wars, then it's plain to see that this is a sign of the times we
are living in.  During the 20th century alone, more people have been killed as a result of war than all previous centuries combined.
This has resulted in HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS of people being killed in wars like World War I, World War II,
Russian Civil War, Congo War, Korean War, Vietnam War, Iraq, etc. Today, there are conflicts and wars
raging all around the world (<a target="_blank" href="http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/world/war/index.html" rel="nofollow">Source</a>). And
in 2011, armed conflicts greatly increased according to <a target="_blank" href="http://phys.org/news/2012-07-armed-conflicts-strongly.html" rel="nofollow">this report</a>.</p>
<p>So is war a sign for today?  Of course is it.  But remember, we are not to take any of these signs ON THEIR OWN. Jesus
said ... <i>&quot;when ye shall see <b><u>all</u> these things</b>, know that it is near&quot;.</i> (Matthew 24:33).  Taking one sign like this
on it's own will not prove we are living in the last days.  <u>All</u> signs need to be fulfilled.</p>
<h2>End Time Sign - FAMINE</h2>
<p class=center><i><b>Matthew 24:7 ...'and there shall be famine.'</b></i></p>
<p>Just look at the famine that has struck the world over the past 30 years. Thousands die everyday of starvation and according to<img src="image/endtimesign-famine.jpg" alt="Signs End Times Famine" width="121" height="87" class="floatright" />
<a target="_blank" href="http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/politics/almost-a-billion-go-hungry-worldwide-8007759.html" rel="nofollow">this news article</a> global starvation is spreading
and increasing causing 1 Billion people to go hungry around the world.  Add to that the failed crops throughout
the world because of extreme weather, and <a target="_blank" href="http://www.end-times-prophecy.org/bee-die-off.html" rel="nofollow">bees dying off</a> in
massive numbers, and we have a worldwide shortage of food on it's way.</p>
<p class=center><span class=fontsizec>Not only that, we have the likes of Monsanto who are poisoning the crops that are left!</span></p>
<p class=center><span class=fontsizec><a target="_blank" href="http://en.ria.ru/society/20141018/194247656/Ban-Ki-Moon-24-Billion-People-Survive-on-Less-Than-2-a-Day.html" rel="nofollow">2.4 BILLION people survive on less than 2 dollars per day!</a></span></p>
<p>The sad thing about this sign, is that the amount of food that is wasted in the developed world could feed the hungry! So think about those in need next time you are
about to fill up your shopping trolley with food that will be wasted. The Bible teaches us that we need to be helping the poor and needy,
by giving them of our bread and clothing.  Rather than throwing away what we don't want or need.</p>
<h2>End Time Sign - CHRISTIANS BEING KILLED</h2>
<p class=center><i><b>Matthew 24:9-10 ...'Then shall they deliver you up to be afflicted, and shall kill you: and ye shall be hated of all nations for my name's
sake.  And then shall many be offended, and shall betray one another, and shall hate one another.'</b></i></p>
<p>Christians were being killed for their faith in the first century, as well as during the dark ages when the Roman Catholic Church ruled
the world and killed tens of millions of God's people. This is being repeated today in places like the Middle East, China, North Korea, Pakistan,
India, Nigeria, Egypt, where many Christians are being killed for their faith in Christ Jesus everyday. And once the mark
of the beast is enforced soon, then this persecution will spread to the Western World.</p>
<h2>End Time Sign - INCREASE IN SIN</h2>
<p class=center><i><b>Matthew 24:12 ...'And because iniquity shall abound, the love of many shall wax cold.'</b></i></p>
<p>Idolatry, Adultery, Violence, Lust, Greed, Disrespect, Homosexuality, Theft, Lying, Aggression, Selfishness.  Is this Biblical sign
fulfilled in our day?  Absolutely! Just go back 50 years and you would not see half the sin and wickedness that we see in people
today.  Look at what is portrayed on our TV screens and in the movies and video games!  Violence, lust and all manner of evil.  This
is one of the major end of time signs.  Our world today is aching under the burden of sin and I'm sure God will not allow it
to continue for much longer.</p>
<p class=center><span class=fontsizec>And do you know the worst thing about &quot;sin&quot; today? It is made into &quot;ENTERTAINMENT&quot;! Through movies, television programs,
radio, magazines, comics, you name it! The majority of people in this world today, <u>including professed Christians</u> are happily entertained by the very thing that put the Son of
God on the cross! What an abomination!</span></p>
<p>And please note, I am not just talking about the sins of non Christians.  A sure sign that we are living in the end times is the fact that the Christian churches are full of unconverted,
sin loving people! Many of them thinking they don't need to keep the ten commandments, and can continue living in sin, as long as
they <i>&quot;believe&quot;</i> in Jesus and go to church once a week. Yes, iniquity has abounded!</p>
<h2>End Time Sign - CHRISTIANS TURN AWAY FROM TRUTH</h2>
<p class=center><i><b>2 Timothy 4:3-4 ...'For the time will come when they will not endure sound doctrine; but after their own lusts
shall they heap to themselves teachers, having itching ears; And they shall turn away their ears from the truth, and shall be turned unto fables.'</b></i></p>
<p>This sign of the times has certainly been fulfilled in our generation.  A great majority of professing Christians these days do not study
the Bible much. Instead they just rely on their pastor's word as the truth.  Let me give you an example. Back during the Protestant
reformation, where many people died standing up for the truth of God's Word. God revealed a great truth to the world about who the
antichrist was.  All of the reformers knew the truth about the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.the-bible-antichrist.com" rel="nofollow">Roman Catholic Church being the Bible
antichrist</a>. But as time has gone on and false teachers have crept into the churches, the majority of Protestants now reject this great truth that God opened up
to the early Protestant leaders, and they now EMBRACE that antichrist church and have become a part of <a target="_blank" href="http://www.end-times-prophecy.org/the-whore-of-babylon.html" rel="nofollow">Babylon</a>!</p>
<p>The above end time sign from Timothy also says that they would be turned unto fables.  Let me give you a few fables that the
majority of Christians have been turned to.  1. <a href="http://www.signs-of-end-times.com/the-rapture.html">The rapture</a>.  2. Looking to <a href="http://www.signs-of-end-times.com/israel-end-times-prophecy.html">Israel for fulfillment of end times prophecy</a>.
3. Mark of the beast being a microchip.  4. The Battle of Armageddon being a physical battle.  And there are many more.</p>
<p class=center><span class=fontsizeb>Please see our <a target="_blank" href="http://www.end-times-prophecy.org" rel="nofollow">prophecy site</a>
for the truth on these topics.</span></p>
<p>Great and precious truths were opened to the people of the Protestant reformation, but the reformation failed because the people did not continue
seeking the truth.  Although God does have
a remnant church with the full gospel truth, we now live in a day where the majority have turned away from the truth and been
turned to fables.  This sign of the end times has certainly been fulfilled in our generation.</p>
<h2>End Time Sign - GOD DESTROY THOSE WHO DESTROY EARTH</h2>
<p class=center><i><b>Revelation 11:18 ...'And <u>the nations were angry</u>, and thy wrath is come, and the time of the dead, that they should be judged, and that
thou shouldest give reward unto thy servants the prophets, and to the saints, and them that fear thy name, small and great; and
shouldest <u>destroy them which destroy the earth</u>.'</b></i></p>
<p>Are the nations angry today?  Yes, we have uprisings, conflicts and wars ALL OVER the earth.  And what about man <img src="image/radioactive-waste.jpg" alt="" width="145" height="129" class="floatright" />destroying the earth?  Well,
all throughout history, the most dangerous weapon that man
had was a bow and arrow.  Man could not do much damage to the earth. But now just look at what man can do and IS doing to the earth through
industry, destructive weapons of war, chemicals, oil exploration, depletion of the forests and so on.  Just look at the massive
oil spills that have happened during the past 30 years around the world. The rivers and seas are becoming completely polluted, and man is certainly destroying 
the earth like no other time in history, and God's wrath is about to fall upon them!</p>
<p>We have been living in the time of judgment since 1844 and once the judgment has ended, THEN Christ Jesus will return to &quot;reward&quot;
the saints and &quot;destroy those who destroy the earth&quot;.</p>
<h2>End Time Sign - GOSPEL PREACHED TO WORLD</h2>
<p class=center><i><b>Matthew 24:14 ...'And this gospel of the kingdom shall be preached in all the world for a witness unto all nations;
and then shall the end come.'</b></i></p>
<p>Notice Jesus said <b><i>&quot;THIS&quot;</i></b> gospel? There are many &quot;gospels&quot; being preached out there, but it is the
<u>TRUE GOSPEL</u> that is to be preached to the world before the end can
come. So is this being fulfilled today as one of the end time signs?  Yes, because God's people are preaching the true
gospel throughout the world like never before, through the internet, tv and satellite, radio, in the pulpit, and through print.  We have
never had the resources available before to reach the world the way we can now.  This ministry alone receives
thousands of visits everyday from people from all over the world seeking the truth.  So yes, this Bible sign is BEING fulfilled now.</p>
<p class=center><span class=fontsizec>What end time message is God's true servants taking to the world today? <a href="http://www.signs-of-end-times.com/three-angels-messages.html" rel="nofollow">THE
EVERLASTING GOSPEL OF REVELATION 14</a></span></p>
<p>Take a look at this interesting quote from the 1980's ... <i>&quot;Before the final end, the world is to hear the message of the
Lord's coming. <u>Had no more rapid means of conveyance and communication been found</u> than existed a century ago, it would have been <u>impossible
to communicate such a message to one generation</u>. But such a work must be done for the last generation ... Then the last generation everywhere
must hear the message, and <u>this calls for rapid transit, and lightning couriers</u> to bear the tidings to various parts of the earth.&quot;</i>
(Bible Readings for the Home, 1988 Ed.)</p>
<p>And what do we have now for &quot;rapid transit&quot; of the gospel message around the world?  The internet and satellite!  We are living
in a time like no other and the gospel message is soon to reach the final corners of the earth, and THEN the final stages of this
earth's history will take place.</p>
<p>But what about all the different languages you may say?  Well, ministries like <a target="_blank" href="http://www.faithcomesbyhearing.com" rel="nofollow">Faith
Comes by Hearing</a> provides a free audio app that shares the Bible in 883 languages!  And that number is growing all the time.
So yes, the languages of the world are being reached with the Word of God.</p>

are not a Christian and you realize that we are living in the end times and are wondering what you need to do, then please
