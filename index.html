<p>  We are in the end times.  Most of the prophesies have been fulfilled and the 'End' may start anytime. It is God's plan that every human being that is born in this earth should know Him and get Salvation which He is offering to everyone freely.  Every person has to face God's judgment on the final day.....  This website is developed to tell everyone that most of Bible's prophesies have been fulfilled and a few which are very terrible are about to be fulfilled. So, are you ready?</p>
